## [Server List](Server-List.md) > Ninja Server

The ninja server provides an API for the eShop. The wood client certificate is need to access this server.

When the eShop is opened, it visits `https://ninja.wup.shop.nintendo.net/ninja/wood_index.html?version=1.0.0&scene=detail&dst_title_id=<%016x>&src_title_id=<%016x>`. The server redirects the eShop to https://geisha-wup.cdn.nintendo.net/geisha/, which serves the real eShop website.

The geisha website accesses the ninja api through javascript. The following requests are known:
