This page describes the protocol that's used to find nearby consoles in LAN mode. In this mode, UDP broadcast packets are used to discover other consoles. LAN mode is not the default mode for local multiplayer. It can usually be enabled by pressing L + R + Left Stick in one of the menus.

The crypto challenge in the [browse request](#0-browse-request) and [reply](#1-browse-reply) uses a [game-specific key](#game-specific-keys).

Every packet starts with a single byte that indicates its type.

## (6) Get Session Reply
This message is encapsulated in a [PIA message](PIA-Protocol) and is encrypted with the session key. The goal of this message is to transmit a [LanSessionInfo](#lansessioninfo) structure. Depending on the size of the [LanSessionInfo](#lansessioninfo), this message may be split into multiple fragments. Each fragment contains up to 800 bytes of data.

| Offset | Size | Description |

## (7) Keep Alive Message
This packet is sent through UDP broadcast port 49152 and is encapsulated in a [PIA message](PIA-Protocol). This message is sent once every two seconds, even if the console is not participating in a session. If the console is participating in a session, the message payload is encrypted with the session key. Otherwise, the payload is not encrypted. The message payload contains the following data:

| 0x0 | 1 | Message type (7) |
| 0x1 | 11 | Padding (always 0) |

## Crypto Challenge
The [browse request](#0-browse-request) contains a cryptographic challenge that must be correctly answered in the [browse reply](#1-browse-reply). Both the challenge and the response have the following format:

| Offset | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x0 | 1 | Version. If 1, the old [InetAddress](PIA-Types#inetaddress) format is used. If 2, the new format is used. |
| 0x1 | 1 | Crypto enabled (0 or 1) |
| 0x2 | 8 | Incrementing counter used for nonce |
| 0xA | 16 | Challenge key |
| 0x1A | 16 | Authentication tag for AES-GCM |
| 0x2A | 256 or 16 | Challenge or response, encrypted with AES-GCM |

The content of the challenge/response when crypto is enabled is described below. If crypto is disabled the authentication tag and challenge/response data are filled with random bytes.

The nonce for the AES-GCM algorithm is generated as follows:

| Offset | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x0 | 4 | Broadcast address (<code>local_address &vert; ~subnet_mask</code>) |
| 0x4 | 8 | Nonce counter |

### Challenge
The challenge consists of 256 random bytes. The key for encrypting the challenge is generated by AES-encrypting the challenge key with the [game-specific key](#game-specific-keys).

### Response
The response contains the first 16 bytes of the HMAC-SHA256 of the decrypted challenge with the [game-specific key](#game-specific-keys). The key for encrypting the response is the first 16 bytes of the HMAC-SHA256 of the following data with the [game-specific key](#game-specific-keys):

| Offset | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x0 | 16 | Challenge key in browse response |
| 0x10 | 16 | Challenge key received in browse request |

## Game-Specific Keys
Most first-party games use [ENL](ENL-Key-Generation) to derive the key.
